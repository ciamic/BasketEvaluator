    /// currencies do not change over time (or, if they do, they do only in rare occasions) 
    /// * The availableCurrencies could have been a fixed instead of fetching every time from the network.
    /// But this has been avoided since the assignment required to show the use of the CurrencyLayer API.
    /// * The network response could have been cached locally (in memory or in disk) possibily with an expiration time.
    /// This would have been the preferred approach but being short in time it has been not yet implemented,
    /// giving priority to the other functionalities of the application.
